		@candidateQuickBio = "In 1999, O’Malley ran for Mayor of Baltimore. At the time, it was the most violent, abandoned, and addicted city in America. Widely considered an underdog candidate, O’Malley campaigned on the promise of reducing crime, improving schools, and rebuilding broken communities. He went on to earn 90 percent of the vote, and got right to work.  Over his seven years as Mayor, O’Malley’s policies helped the people of Baltimore achieve the greatest crime reduction of America’s largest cities. He also promoted important investments in the local economy—bringing fiscal stability to schools and cracking down on crime, which drew investments and people back to the city."
